# BPTI (Basispraktikum Technische Informatik : Systemnaher Hardwareentwurf)
This is the repository for a FPGA practical course which the contributors attended at Winter Term 2017/18 at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).
It contains our working set of VHDL files and reports describing our code. All VHDL code is developed for the Xilinx 3A-DSP Starter Board.
The probably most interesting part is the project/ folder which contains all the code and documentation for a bomberman game we developed as our final project. The code may be synthesized with Xilinx-ISE and can be used with controllers connected to the SAM pins of the FPGA.
Here is a screenshot of the final game:
